# What is ShredOS?

## Introduction

ShredOS is a specialized bootable Linux distribution designed to provide reliable and secure disk erasure on x86_64 and i686 platforms. It leverages the proven capabilities of the **nwipe** utility—a continuation of the well-known DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) and its fork dwipe—to ensure data is irrecoverably wiped from storage devices.

This project evolved to address the need for a trusted, actively maintained tool that simplifies the process of securely destroying data on various drives, making ShredOS a go-to solution for sensitive data sanitization in enterprise, government, and personal settings.

## Core Mission and Purpose

ShredOS is built to empower users with a user-friendly yet powerful tool to safely erase disks, removing all data traces in a verifiable manner. Its mission is to provide peace of mind when disposing of or repurposing storage hardware by making secure erasure straightforward and reliable.

## Historical Background and Evolution

The roots of ShredOS trace back to **nwipe**, which itself is a reboot of the classic and widely trusted DBAN project. DBAN gained recognition as the de facto standard utility for data destruction via bootable media. However, with the original project no longer maintained, nwipe emerged to modernize and maintain this essential functionality.

ShredOS extends nwipe by packaging it into a dedicated Linux distribution, featuring an easy-to-navigate graphical interface, along with integration into a compact, self-contained system image. This evolution ensures ongoing support, updated hardware compatibility, and a streamlined user experience.

## Why Trust ShredOS for Secure Data Erasure?

- **Proven technology:** Utilizes nwipe, inheriting robustness from DBAN and dwipe.
- **Bootable Linux environment:** Lightweight and dedicated to the disk wiping task.
- **Platform support:** Specifically crafted for x86_64 and i686 architectures, covering a wide range of PC hardware.
- **Verifiable erasure:** Ensures that destroyed data cannot be recovered by conventional means.
- **Updated and maintained:** Regularly updated kernels, drivers, and dependencies to support evolving storage technologies.

## How ShredOS Works

At boot, ShredOS launches a minimal Linux system configured to run nwipe. Nwipe scans all available storage devices, presenting options to perform various wipe methods, including but not limited to:

- Single-pass writes with zeros or random data
- Multiple overwrite passes per DoD standards
- Custom wipe patterns

### Example of Boot Entry in ShredOS

The bootloader—GRUB in this case—uses a straightforward configuration to directly invoke the disk erasure kernel image:

```sh
set default="0"
set timeout="0"

menuentry "shredos" {
	linux /boot/shredos console=tty3 loglevel=3
}
```

This initiates the ShredOS kernel and starts the wiping utility.

## Integration With Buildroot

ShredOS is built using the Buildroot system, a powerful tool to generate embedded Linux systems. The defconfig for ShredOS targets x86_64 and i386 architectures, ensuring compatibility with typical PC platforms. Configurations include:

- Glibc-based toolchain
- System V init system
- Locale and timezone support
- Rich package selection tailored for wiping and hardware support

File system overlays and custom post-image scripts fine-tune the final output for ShredOS usage.

### Example Configuration Snippet from shredos_defconfig

```ini
BR2_x86_64=y
BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_CXX=y
BR2_INIT_SYSV=y
BR2_ROOTFS_MERGED_USR=y
BR2_PACKAGE_NWIPE=y
BR2_PACKAGE_GLIBC_UTILS=y
BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY="board/shredos/fsoverlay"
BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT="board/shredos/doimg.sh"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE="board/shredos/kernel-6.6.22-defconfig.config"
```

This setup highlights the components that shape ShredOS's lifecycle and features.

## Summary

ShredOS has emerged as a dedicated, modern successor to DBAN and dwipe, using the proven nwipe core within an actively maintained, bootable Linux environment. Intended for secure disk erasure on mainstream PC architectures, ShredOS brings together robust wiping capabilities with a reliable Linux system designed for minimal fuss and maximum security.

This documentation aims to introduce you to ShredOS, explain its purpose and heritage, and help you understand why it is a trusted choice for secure data destruction.
