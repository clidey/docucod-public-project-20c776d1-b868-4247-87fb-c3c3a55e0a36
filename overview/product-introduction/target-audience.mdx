## Who Uses ShredOS?

ShredOS is designed for a diverse set of users who share a common goal: ensuring that data is irrecoverably destroyed from storage devices. Understanding the intended audience helps highlight why ShredOS fits such a broad range of use cases.

### IT Administrators

IT admins manage organizational hardware lifecycles, often handling sensitive data clearance tasks. They depend on ShredOS for:
- Bulk erasure of systems being decommissioned or repurposed
- Compliance with data privacy and security policies
- Simple, scripted workflows to enable rapid, reliable wipes

### Refurbishers

Businesses refurbishing used computers require a secure method to wipe hard drives before resale or redeployment. ShredOS helps refurbishers:
- Clean devices of all previous data to protect previous owner privacy
- Work efficiently on multiple machines, including multi-disk racks
- Automate wiping processes to increase throughput and reduce errors

### Data Privacy Professionals

Privacy officers and data protection teams are tasked with enforcing regulatory compliance. For them, ShredOS serves as:
- A reliable tool to meet stringent data destruction mandates
- A way to generate documented erasure workflows with verifiable certifications
- A solution adaptable to complex environments, including headless or network-booted systems

### Individuals

Anyone concerned about personal data security before selling or discarding a PC or laptop can use ShredOS to:
- Ensure their personal information is completely removed
- Use a straightforward, trustworthy tool without requiring OS-level utilities
- Prepare devices securely even without advanced technical knowledge

## Common ShredOS Usage Scenarios

Below are concrete examples of how ShredOS fits naturally into diverse workflows, emphasizing its flexibility and adaptability.

### Secure Wiping Before Resale or Disposal

When preparing a single PC or Mac for resale, ShredOS provides a proven way to sanitize disks without relying on the original operating system. This avoids potential malware or user errors:
- Boot from a USB or CD/DVD containing ShredOS
- Easily select disks for wiping through an interactive menu
- Complete a verified full wipe that erases all partitions and file systems

### Multi-Disk Erasure for Servers and Racks

Data centers or refurbishers working with racks of servers benefit from ShredOS’s robust handling of multi-disk arrays:
- Simultaneously wipe multiple drives using automation or batch processing modes
- Efficiently process large inventories while minimizing manual interventions
- Support hardware with multiple SATA, SAS, or NVMe drives

### Headless or Remote System Erasure

In environments where physical access is limited or impossible, ShredOS supports headless operation:
- Use PXE or network boot to load ShredOS remotely
- Operate wiping through command-line or scripted interfaces over the network
- Integrate with remote management tools for centralized control

### Preparation for Secure Device Disposal

Before discarding or recycling hardware, ShredOS ensures that no residual data remains that could be exploited:
- Wipe internal and external drives safely and thoroughly
- Use verified erasure methods to meet compliance standards
- Export logs or certificates to track and document the erasure process
