## Supported Architectures

- **x86_64 and i686 architectures:** ShredOS is tailored to work seamlessly on the most common PC architectures, ensuring broad compatibility across desktops, laptops, and servers.

## Wipe Methods

- **Multiple overwrite methods including DoD, Gutmann, and more:** Choose from industry-standard secure erase algorithms to match compliance requirements or internal policies.
- **Firmware enhanced erase support:** Optimized erase commands for SSDs and NVMe drives using vendor firmware when available, enabling faster and more reliable sanitization.

## Device and Interface Support

- **SATA, SAS, USB, NVMe device compatibility:** Wipe all common disk and solid state drives through direct connection methods.
- **Support for common USB adapters:** Increased hardware compatibility for USB external drives and enclosures.

## User Interfaces

- **Graphical UI:** Easy-to-use interface for interactive wipe sessions.
- **Command-line mode:** Full control via terminal for scriptable, headless operations.
- **Autonuke mode:** Fully automated wipe based on pre-configured settings for unattended use.

## Automation and Integration

- **PXE (network) boot support:** Deploy ShredOS at scale on server racks or large data centers with network boot capabilities.
- **Ventoy multi-boot compatibility:** Add ShredOS conveniently alongside other utilities on a single USB drive.
- **Autonuke scripting:** Customize wipe automation precisely.

## Output and Logging

- **Certificate and log generation:** Generate detailed audit trails documenting wipe parameters and results.
- **Options for auto-saving certificates/logs to USB or network storage:** Streamline compliance and auditing workflows.

## Additional Utilities

- **Disk analysis and utilities:** Tools like `hdparm` and `smartmontools` for drive health assessment and optimization.

## Getting Started with These Features

To begin exploring ShredOS capabilities:

1. **Select the appropriate wipe method** for your drive type and security requirements.
2. **Choose the user interface mode**—interactive GUI, command-line, or autonuke for automation.
3. **Configure certificates and logging options** to suit auditing policies.
4. **Deploy with your preferred boot method,** including USB, PXE, or Ventoy multi-boot.

## Tips and Best Practices

- When using firmware erases on SSDs or NVMe drives, validate device support first.
- Use PXE boot with autonuke mode for efficiently wiping multiple machines simultaneously.
- Leverage logging and certificate generation to streamline compliance audits.
- Customize keyboard layout and language settings to match your operational environment.

## Troubleshooting

Common troubleshooting includes:

- Device not detected: Check USB adapters and cables, consult compatibility list.
- Boot issues: Confirm correct boot media creation; Ventoy compatibility sometimes requires updates.
- Wipe speed optimization: Choose firmware erase methods where supported.
- Certificate failures: Ensure output targets are correctly mounted and accessible.
