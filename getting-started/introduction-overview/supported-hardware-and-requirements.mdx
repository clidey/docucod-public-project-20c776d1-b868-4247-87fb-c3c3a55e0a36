# System Requirements & Supported Hardware

Understanding the system requirements and supported hardware is critical for a smooth and efficient deployment of ShredOS. This document outlines the supported CPU architectures, minimum hardware specifications, and necessary boot method support to ensure compatibility across various platforms.

---

## 1. Supported CPU Architectures

ShredOS supports secure erasure on several popular CPU architectures. Your system's CPU must be one of the following to guarantee full compatibility:

- **x86_64 (64-bit Intel/AMD)**
- **i386 (32-bit Intel/AMD)**

These architectures are supported by the underlying Linux system and the nwipe utility on which ShredOS is based.

### Notes on Architecture Support

- ShredOS currently targets only `x86_64` and `i386`. Other CPU architectures, such as ARM or PowerPC, are outside the scope of this release.
- Compatibility includes common PC and server hardware using these architectures.

---

## 2. Minimum Hardware Specifications

To run ShredOS effectively, your hardware must meet these minimum specifications:

### CPU
- Must be compatible with `x86_64` or `i386` instruction sets.

### Memory (RAM)
- Minimum: 1 GB RAM
- Recommended: 2 GB or more for smoother operation and to support advanced features.

### Storage
- USB flash drive or optical media (CD/DVD) capable of booting ShredOS.
- Sufficient storage capacity to hold the ShredOS bootable image (typically 1 GB or larger USB drive).

### Boot Support
- **BIOS or UEFI** firmware capable of booting from USB or optical media.

---

## 3. USB and Optical Media Compatibility

ShredOS can be booted from USB flash drives or CD/DVD media.

### USB Boot
- Requires that the target system's BIOS or UEFI supports booting from USB devices.
- USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports supported; no special USB adapters required.

### Optical Media Boot
- Compatible with CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives.
- Works on systems with legacy BIOS or UEFI firmware.

<Tip>
Before creating bootable media, verify your system's BIOS/UEFI settings to enable booting from the desired media type.
</Tip>

## 4. BIOS vs. UEFI Booting

ShredOS supports both legacy BIOS and modern UEFI boot methods, ensuring broad hardware compatibility.

### BIOS (Legacy)
- Standard BIOS boot is supported on most traditional PC hardware.
- Suitable for older systems without UEFI support.

### UEFI
- Fully supported, including Secure Boot disabled or properly configured systems.
- Recommended for newer hardware.

<Warning>
Secure Boot must be disabled or configured to allow ShredOS to boot on UEFI systems, as ShredOS does not currently support Secure Boot signatures.
</Warning>

## 5. Recommended ShredOS Releases per System Type

| System Type       | Recommended ShredOS Release          | Notes                                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 32-bit (i386) PCs  | ShredOS i386-compatible build      | Compatible with older hardware                 |
| 64-bit PCs        | ShredOS x86_64 default build       | Supports latest CPUs and features              |
| Legacy BIOS       | Use latest stable Buildroot based release | Ensure BIOS supports USB/CD booting    |
| UEFI Systems      | Use latest UEFI-enabled ShredOS build | Disable Secure Boot if required               |

---

## 6. Additional Supported Hardware Considerations

### Disk Types
ShredOS supports wiping of a wide variety of disks detected by the underlying Linux kernel, including but not limited to:

- SATA HDDs and SSDs
- NVMe drives
- USB-connected storage devices

### Common Hardware Drivers Supported
Full support is included for relevant storage, USB, and filesystem drivers present in the ShredOS kernel build.

<Note>
Specific exotic hardware or non-x86 architectures may require custom kernel builds or are currently unsupported.
</Note>

---

## 7. Verifying Hardware Compatibility Before Use

Before deployment, ensure your system meets compatibility criteria:

1. **Check CPU Architecture:**
   ```bash
   uname -m
   # Outputs: x86_64 (64-bit) or i686/i386 (32-bit)
   ```
2. **Check BIOS/UEFI Boot Options:**
   - Access firmware setup and confirm boot order supports USB and/or optical boot.

3. **Confirm Sufficient RAM:**
   - Minimum 1 GB RAM present.

4. **Identify Disk Devices:**
   - Use Linux live environment or BIOS HDD info to verify disk presence.

<Warning>
If the system does not meet the above minimum requirements, booting ShredOS may fail or performance may be degraded.
</Warning>

---

## 8. Summary

ShredOS is designed for x86_64 and i386 PCs, running effectively on hardware with at least 1 GB RAM and with BIOS or UEFI capable of booting from USB or optical drive. Ensuring your system meets these prerequisites will enable a straightforward setup and successful secure drive erasure experience.
