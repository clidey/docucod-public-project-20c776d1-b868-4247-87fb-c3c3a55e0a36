# Create Bootable USB or CD/DVD

Securely running ShredOS requires creating reliable, bootable installation media. This guide walks you through creating bootable USB flash drives or CD/DVD discs using your Linux, Windows, or Mac system with practical tools like `dd`, Rufus, or Etcher. You'll also learn to verify your media integrity to avoid boot failures caused by corrupt or incomplete writes.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **ShredOS Image/ISO**: Download the latest ShredOS image from the [Download ShredOS](../installation-setup/download-shredos) page.
- **Target Media**: An empty USB flash drive (4GB or larger) or CD/DVD disc.
- **System with creating tools**:
  - Linux system with `dd` utility
  - Windows with Rufus
  - macOS with `dd` or Etcher


<Tip>
Always back up any existing data on the USB drive or CD/DVD before starting, as this process will erase all content.
</Tip>

## 2. Creating Bootable USB on Linux/macOS Using `dd`

Linux and macOS users can leverage the built-in `dd` command-line utility to write ShredOS images to USB drives.

### Step-by-step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Downloaded Image">
Run:
```bash
sha256sum shredos-image.iso
```
Compare the output with the published checksum on the download site to ensure file integrity.
</Step>

<Step title="Identify USB Device">
List your devices:
```bash
lsblk
```
or
```bash
diskutil list
```
Make note of your USB device path (e.g., `/dev/sdb` on Linux or `/dev/disk2` on macOS).

> **WARNING:** Be certain about the device path or you risk overwriting critical data!
</Step>

<Step title="Unmount USB Drive">
Unmount any mounted partitions of the USB drive.

On Linux:
```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb1
```
On macOS:
```bash
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
```
</Step>

<Step title="Write Image to USB">
Run the following command (adjust device path and image filename):

```bash
sudo dd if=shredos-image.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`). On macOS, use `/dev/rdiskX` for faster writes.
</Step>

<Step title="Sync and Eject">
Make sure data is flushed:
```bash
sync
```
Unmount and safely eject the device:
```bash
diskutil eject /dev/disk2
```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify USB Media}">
Optional: Remount USB and check files or use checksum tools to confirm the write.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The `bs=4M` block size speeds up the copying process while `conv=fsync` ensures data integrity.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Never use the partition path (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`) for `dd`, always the whole device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).
</Warning>

## 3. Creating Bootable USB on Windows with Rufus

Rufus offers a simple GUI for writing ShredOS images onto USB drives on Windows systems.

### Steps

1. Download and launch [Rufus](https://rufus.ie).
2. Insert your USB drive; Rufus should detect it automatically.
3. Under "Boot selection," click "Select" and pick your downloaded ShredOS ISO file.
4. Leave partition scheme as "MBR" or "GPT" depending on your target system firmware (BIOS or UEFI).
5. Click "Start" and confirm any prompts.
6. Wait for the process to complete until the status bar shows "READY."
7. Safely eject your USB drive.

<Note>
Use GPT partition scheme for UEFI-based modern systems and MBR for legacy BIOS machines.
</Note>

## 4. Creating Bootable CD/DVD on Any OS

If you prefer optical media, burn the ShredOS ISO image to a CD or DVD using the following instructions.

### On Windows

- Use Windows built-in disc image burner:
  1. Right-click the ISO file.
  2. Select "Burn disc image."
  3. Choose your optical drive.
  4. Click "Burn".

- Alternatively, use third-party software like ImgBurn.

### On Linux

- Using command line:
  ```bash
  wodim dev=/dev/cdrom shredos-image.iso
  ```
- Using GUI applications like Brasero or K3b to burn ISO images.

### On macOS

- Open Disk Utility.
- Select "Burn" from the File menu.
- Choose the ISO image and your disc.
- Click "Burn."

<Warning>
Use high-quality blank media and burn at a moderate speed to reduce errors.
</Warning>

## 5. Validating the Bootable Media

After creating your bootable media, validation is essential to avoid boot failures.

### Validation tips

- **Checksum Comparison**: Check the downloaded image's checksum before writing and verify any files on the USB after writing.
- **Test Boot in Virtual Environment**: Use QEMU or VirtualBox to test booting from the created media prior to live deployment.
- **Device Detection**: Confirm that your target system recognizes the USB or CD/DVD as a boot device.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Bootable Media Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="USB Not Booting">
- Check BIOS/UEFI settings to enable USB boot.
- Ensure Secure Boot is disabled or the media is signed properly.
- Try different USB port types (USB 2.0 vs USB 3.0).
- Recreate media to rule out write errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Corrupt or Incomplete Writes">
- Verify checksum of the source ISO.
- Use recommended tools without interrupting the write process.
- Avoid removing the media prematurely.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Media Not Recognized on Target System">
- Confirm media format matches system firmware (UEFI vs BIOS).
- Try alternative USB drives or CDs/DVDs.
- Update your system firmware to latest version.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

- Once your bootable media is ready and verified, proceed to the [First Boot: What to Expect](../first-use-configuration/first-boot-expectations) guide to learn how to boot into ShredOS and start wiping operations.
- For advanced multi-boot setups, see [Ventoy and Multi-Boot](../installation-setup/ventoy-and-multi-boot).
- Explore [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-advanced/common-issues) if you encounter difficulties during boot.
