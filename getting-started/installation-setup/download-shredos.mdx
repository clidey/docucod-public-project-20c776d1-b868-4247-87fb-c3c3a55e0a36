# Download ShredOS

This guide helps you select and download the correct ShredOS image or ISO file tailored for your hardware setup, ensuring you get a secure, safe, and up-to-date build for your disk erasure needs.

---

## 1. Understanding Your Hardware and Requirements

Before downloading ShredOS, ensure you have identified key hardware and boot characteristics:

- **Architecture:** Determine if your system is 32-bit (i586/i386) or 64-bit (x86_64). ShredOS offers images for both.
- **Boot Firmware Type:** Does your system boot using Legacy BIOS or UEFI? Images support USB and CD/DVD boot for both, but there are some distinctions noted below.
- **Boot Medium:** Decide whether you'll create a USB boot drive or boot from a CD/DVD. This affects whether you download `.img` (USB) or `.iso` (optical media) files.

<div>
  <Check>
    To verify your system architecture:
    
    - On Linux or macOS, run: <code>uname -m</code>
    - If output is <code>x86_64</code>, use the 64-bit image; if <code>i686</code> or <code>i386</code>, use the 32-bit image.
  </Check>
</div>

## 2. Selecting the ShredOS Build

ShredOS provides multiple release versions, including stable latest releases and pre-release builds. Consider:

- **Latest Stable Release:** The thoroughly tested, recommended version for most users.
- **Pre-Releases:** Newer versions with additional features or fixes, but potentially less tested.

### Recommended Download Choices

| Version | Description | Typical User | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Latest Stable Release | Full set of 32 and 64-bit `.img` and `.iso` files | Most users | Safe, stable, supports BIOS & UEFI boot |
| Latest Pre-release | Usually latest 64-bit `.img` only | Advanced users, need newest features | Testing recommended before production use |

---

## 3. Available Image Types

- **`.img` Files**: Designed for writing directly to USB flash drives. Supports BIOS and UEFI boot.
- **`.iso` Files**: Designed for burning to CD/DVD or booting with tools like Ventoy. Currently supports legacy BIOS boot only, UEFI ISO support is in development.

<Tip>
.img files are recommended if you want a USB bootable medium and want UEFI support.
.iso files are suitable for legacy BIOS CD/DVD boot or Ventoy users who want to quickly manage multiple boot images.

## 5. Verifying Download Integrity

Always verify the integrity of downloaded files to avoid corrupted or tampered images.

### Linux/macOS

Use `sha1sum` or `shasum` and compare against checksums published in the release notes:

```bash
sha1sum shredos-2024.11_27_x86-64_0.38_20250123.img
```

For macOS:

```bash
shasum shredos-2024.11_27_x86-64_0.38_20250123.img
```

### Windows

Use tools like [Hashtab](http://implbits.com/products/hashtab/) to check SHA-1 checksums.

## 6. Tips for Download Selection

- If your target system supports UEFI boot and you want to boot from USB, download the `.img` 64-bit version.
- For legacy BIOS systems, the `.iso` is an option if burning to CD/DVD.
- To boot multiple OS images from one USB, consider using [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) and just copy `.img` or `.iso` files to the Ventoy USB stick.
- If you need a 32-bit image for older hardware, use the appropriate 32-bit `.img` or `.iso` from the releases.

---

## 7. Secure and Up-to-Date Builds

ShredOS images include the latest stable or pre-release versions of nwipe and kernel fixes for the broadest hardware compatibility.

- Use the latest stable release unless you require cutting-edge fixes.
- Check the GitHub [Releases Page](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64/releases) regularly for updates and pre-release notes.

---

## 8. Quick Notes on Usage After Download

- Use the downloaded `.img` file to create a bootable USB flash drive via utilities like `dd` on Linux/macOS or Rufus/Etcher on Windows.
- Burn `.iso` files directly to CD/DVD media or use with Ventoy-compatible USB sticks.
- After booting, nwipe’s interactive GUI will launch, ready to select drives and wipe methods.

<Tip>
Always double-check the device(s) selected for wiping to avoid irreversible data loss on the wrong drives.

## 9. Troubleshooting Download and Selection Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Downloading or Selecting Images">

<Accordion title="I’m not sure whether to choose 32-bit or 64-bit images">
Verify your CPU architecture using `uname -m`. Choose 64-bit images for `x86_64` and 32-bit for `i386` or `i586`. If unsure, 32-bit images are compatible with some 64-bit CPUs but may limit performance and hardware support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which image should I download for USB boot vs CD/DVD?">
Download `.img` files for USB drives and `.iso` files for optical media. Note that `.iso` files currently do not support UEFI boot on ShredOS but `.img` files do.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does my USB boot fail after writing an .img file?">
Check that you wrote the image correctly with `dd` or a trusted utility. Confirm your system supports USB boot and the firmware settings (legacy BIOS/UEFI) align with the image type. Refer to the [Booting and Running ShredOS](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64) guide for additional assistance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want to use Ventoy, but how do I modify the boot options?">
Ventoy boots any `.img` or `.iso` copied to the USB drive. To customize kernel command line options such as keyboard layout or nwipe flags, unpack the `.img` file, edit `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg`, then repack the image and copy it to Ventoy. Follow the detailed instructions in the ShredOS README.md documentation.
