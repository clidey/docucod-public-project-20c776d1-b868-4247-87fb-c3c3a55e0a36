# Advanced: Multi-Boot with Ventoy

Securely erasing disks with ShredOS can be seamlessly integrated alongside other operating systems on the same bootable media using Ventoy, a versatile multi-boot USB solution. This guide walks you through copying ShredOS images onto a Ventoy USB drive, editing boot configurations within ShredOS `.img` files, and validating your Ventoy setup to ensure smooth multi-boot operation.

---

## 1. Introduction to Ventoy Multi-Boot

Ventoy simplifies booting multiple ISO and IMG images from a single USB drive without repeatedly formatting or re-imaging the device. ShredOS images can coexist with other OS installers or utilities, allowing you to select which system to launch at boot.

This approach is ideal for IT professionals who need to carry multiple tools in one portable device, improving workflow efficiency and minimizing downtime.

## 2. Preparing Your Ventoy USB Drive for ShredOS

### Prerequisites

- A USB drive with sufficient capacity for the images you intend to use.
- Ventoy installed on your USB drive. Download from [Ventoy Official Site](https://www.ventoy.net).
- ShredOS `.img` or `.iso` files ready for deployment.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Ventoy on USB Drive">
1. Download and run the Ventoy installer appropriate for your OS.
2. Select your USB device carefully—data on this device will be erased.
3. Click "Install" to set up Ventoy on the drive.
4. Upon success, the USB drive is ready to hold multiple boot images.
</Step>
<Step title="Copy ShredOS and Other Images">
1. Open the Ventoy USB drive in your file explorer.
2. Copy the ShredOS `.img` or `.iso` file(s) directly onto the root of the USB.
3. Copy additional ISOs or IMG files for other operating systems or utilities.
</Step>
<Step title="Boot into Ventoy and Select Image">
1. Insert the Ventoy USB into your target machine.
2. Configure BIOS/UEFI to boot from USB.
3. Ventoy boot menu will appear listing all bootable images.
4. Select the ShredOS image to start the secure erase session.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Always verify the integrity of your ShredOS images before copying them to Ventoy. This prevents boot failures caused by corrupted files.
</Note>

## 3. Customizing the Boot Menu (Editing grub.cfg inside .img files)

ShredOS images contain an embedded bootloader configuration (e.g., GRUB). To tailor boot options, such as kernel parameters or default selections, you may edit the `grub.cfg` inside the `.img` file.

### Editing Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Mount the ShredOS Image">
1. On a Linux host, create a mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/shredos_img
```

2. Mount the image:

```bash
sudo mount -o loop path/to/shredos.img /mnt/shredos_img
```
</Step>
<Step title="Locate and Edit grub.cfg">
1. Navigate to the `boot/grub2/` directory in the mounted image:

```bash
cd /mnt/shredos_img/boot/grub2
```

2. Edit the `grub.cfg` file with your preferred text editor:

```bash
sudo nano grub.cfg
```

3. Customize kernel parameters or menu entries as needed, for example changing console settings or adding autonuke options.
</Step>
<Step title="Unmount the Image">
1. Save changes and exit the editor.
2. Unmount the image:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/shredos_img
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Be cautious when editing the boot configuration. Incorrect syntax can prevent ShredOS from booting properly.
</Tip>

## 4. Validating your Ventoy Setup

Before deploying in production or critical environments, confirm that Ventoy boots ShredOS and other images correctly.

### Validation Checklist

- **Boot Menu Appearance:** Ventoy shows all copied images at startup.
- **ShredOS Boot Success:** Selecting ShredOS boots to the main menu or runs autonuke as expected.
- **Multi-Boot Confirmed:** Other OS images boot without errors.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Ventoy & ShredOS Multi-Boot Issues">
<Accordion title="ShredOS Does Not Appear in Ventoy Menu">
- Verify the image file is directly on the USB root or properly nested within folders.
- Ensure the image file extension is supported (`.iso`, `.img`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Boot Fails with Error Message">
- Confirm BIOS/UEFI settings are correct (legacy vs UEFI boot mode).
- Check image integrity using SHA256 or MD5 checksums.
- Test booting the image standalone from another USB outside Ventoy to isolate the issue.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom grub.cfg Changes Not Applied">
- Double-check you edited the correct `grub.cfg` inside the image.
- Verify the image was properly unmounted and changes saved.
- Some images may use embedded configs that require rebuilding. Refer to ShredOS build docs.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- Keep your Ventoy installation updated to the latest version for improved compatibility.
- Use descriptive file names for images on the Ventoy USB to avoid confusion.
- Backup your Ventoy USB contents regularly.
- When editing boot configurations, document changes for repeatability and troubleshooting.
- Test in a non-critical environment before deploying on live systems.

## 6. Next Steps

After successfully setting up ShredOS with Ventoy:

- Explore automated wipe modes like `autonuke` by customizing boot parameters.
- Set up PXE network booting for remote deployment (see 'Booting and Running ShredOS' guide).
- Review related topics on ShredOS configuration and troubleshooting for advanced use.

## Example: Copying ShredOS Image to Ventoy USB on Linux

```bash
# Assuming Ventoy USB is mounted at /media/user/VENTOY
cp path/to/shredos_amd64.img /media/user/VENTOY/

# Optionally copy other ISOs
cp path/to/ubuntu.iso /media/user/VENTOY/
echo "Files copied."
```

On reboot, Ventoy’s menu will list both images for easy selection.
