# Building ShredOS from Source

*For advanced users: Complete instructions to build ShredOS from source with Buildroot. Learn about required packages, configuration via menuconfig, kernel options, and output validation. Includes troubleshooting build errors (e.g., mtools issues) and where to find or modify key overlays.*

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Preparation

Before starting the build process, ensure your Linux host system meets the following requirements:

- **Mandatory Packages:** `make` (3.81+), `gcc` (4.8+), `g++` (4.8+), `binutils`, `sed`, `patch`, `gzip`, `bzip2`, `perl` (5.8.7+), `tar`, `cpio`, `unzip`, `rsync`, `file` (must be located at `/usr/bin/file`), `bc`, `findutils`, and `wget`.

- **Optional Packages:** Recommended packages depending on your build interface preference:
  - For `menuconfig`: `ncurses5` (runtime + development)
  - For `xconfig`: `qt5` (runtime + development)
  - For `gconfig`: `glib2`, `gtk2`, and `glade2`
  - For documentation build: `asciidoc` (8.6.3+), `w3m`, `python` (2.7+), and `dblatex`
  - For dependency graphs: `graphviz` and `python-matplotlib`

- **Host System:** A Linux distribution with the above packages installed. Buildroot is designed to run from a Linux host.

- **Buildroot Source:** Obtain the latest Buildroot source from the official repository or stable releases.


<Check>
Make sure all mandatory and recommended packages are installed on your host OS.

## 2. Configuring Buildroot for ShredOS

### 2.1 Starting the Configuration Interface

Navigate to the root of your Buildroot source tree, then invoke a configuration tool. You have several interfaces available depending on your installed dependencies:

```bash
$ make menuconfig
# or
$ make nconfig
# or
$ make xconfig
# or
$ make gconfig
```

These commands build and start the configuration interface. Choose the one you are most comfortable with.

### 2.2 Selecting Target Architecture & Toolchain

- Go to the `Target Architecture` menu and select the relevant CPU architecture supported by ShredOS (e.g., `x86_64`).

- Under the `Toolchain` menu, choose between:
  - **Internal toolchain backend** (Buildroot builds the toolchain) or
  - **External toolchain backend** (Use an external pre-built cross-toolchain).

  For building ShredOS from source, the internal Buildroot toolchain is typically used for simplicity and integration.

- Configure the C library (glibc, uClibc-ng, musl) in the internal toolchain options, compatible with ShredOS needs.

- Set the Linux kernel headers version to match the kernel version targeted in your build.

### 2.3 Configuring Kernel and Other Packages

- Configure your Linux kernel (via `make linux-menuconfig`) to include necessary options for your target hardware and ShredOS requirements.

- Select BusyBox and other essential packages. You can customize BusyBox via `make busybox-menuconfig`.

- Be aware that some kernel or package options require full rebuilds on changes.

### 2.4 Using Buildroot Search Tools

- Use `/` in `menuconfig` or `Ctrl+f` in `xconfig` to search for configuration options quickly.

- Search results show the help texts and shortcut numbers.


<Note>
Use the search feature to quickly locate toolchain, kernel, and package configuration options relevant to ShredOS.
</Note>

## 3. Building the System

### 3.1 Executing the Build

After all configuration options are set, run:

```bash
$ make
```

- The build will proceed through downloading source packages, building the toolchain (if internal), compiling selected packages, kernel, and bootloader, and generating the root filesystem images.

- Build output will be placed in the `output/` directory within the Buildroot tree.

### 3.2 Build Output Structure

- `output/images/` – Final images for kernel, bootloader, root filesystem.
- `output/build/` – Intermediate build directories for packages.
- `output/host/` – Host tools and toolchain sysroot.
- `output/staging/` – Target toolchain sysroot.
- `output/target/` – Almost complete root filesystem (do NOT use this on the actual device).

### 3.3 Handling Build Issues

- If the build fails with errors related to specific packages (e.g., mtools issues), carefully inspect the build logs located in `output/build/<package>/`.

- Resolve any missing dependencies or conflicts by revisiting the configuration or updating your host packages.

- Run `make clean` to clean the build if needed (note that full toolchain rebuild will occur).


<Tip>
Enable verbose output during build with `make V=1` to see detailed command execution and error details.
</Tip>

## 4. Customizing and Overriding Overlays

### 4.1 Root Filesystem Overlays

- ShredOS supports file overlays to modify or add files to the target root filesystem.

- Overlays are set using the `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` configuration option.

- Recommended location for overlay files is `board/<company>/<boardname>/rootfs-overlay/` within the Buildroot directory.

- Use overlays to add custom configuration files, splash screens, or other resources.

### 4.2 Post-Build and Post-Image Scripts

- Post-build scripts (`BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT`) execute after building packages and before image assembly.

- Post-image scripts (`BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT`) run after image creation, useful for extra processing such as packaging firmware images.

- Scripts receive the target filesystem or images directory path as their first argument.

### 4.3 Setting Permissions and Devices

- Use permission tables (`BR2_ROOTFS_DEVICE_TABLE`) for setting ownership and permissions.

- Use static device tables (`BR2_ROOTFS_STATIC_DEVICE_TABLE`) to define device nodes if needed.

- For more details on the format, see Buildroot’s Makedev syntax documentation (Chapter 25).


<Note>
Avoid modifying the target filesystem directly under `output/target/` as these changes do not survive clean builds.
</Note>

## 5. Verifying the Build and Output

### 5.1 Confirm Build Success

- Check that `make` completes without errors.

- Verify that output images in `output/images/` are present and appropriately sized.

### 5.2 Test Booting and Runtime

- Use QEMU or hardware devices to boot the generated images.

- Validate that essential functionality of ShredOS is operational.

### 5.3 Troubleshooting Common Build Errors

- **mtools Issues:** Errors related to `mtools` usually involve missing or incompatible package versions. Confirm that host tools meet the minimum version requirements.

- **Toolchain Problems:** Ensure correct selection between internal and external toolchains, and matching kernel headers.

- **Missing Dependencies:** Use `make help` and `make printvars` to identify missing configuration settings.

- **Device Nodes:** If the system doesn’t boot due to missing device files, verify `/dev` management settings.


## 6. Advanced - Building a Custom External Toolchain

### 6.1 Generating a Custom External Toolchain

- Use Buildroot to build an internal toolchain configured for your target.

- Disable unnecessary services (`BusyBox`, root filesystem archiving).

- Run `make sdk` to generate an SDK tarball containing the toolchain.

- Reuse this SDK tarball as an external toolchain in other Buildroot builds.

### 6.2 Configuring Buildroot to Use This External Toolchain

- In the Toolchain menu, select `External toolchain > Custom toolchain`.

- Set `Toolchain URL` to `file:///path/to/sdk.tar.gz` or specify local install path.

- Fill in `Toolchain prefix` with your toolchain’s prefix string (usually `<arch>-linux`).

- Specify the external toolchain’s C library (glibc, uClibc, musl).

- Specify advanced settings such as C++ support, RPC, threads according to the toolchain features.


## 7. Useful Commands for Development and Debugging

### 7.1 Make Targets

- `make <package>` – Build and install a specific package.
- `make <package>-dirclean` – Remove a package's build directory to force full rebuild.
- `make <package>-rebuild` – Rebuild a package’s compiled components.
- `make <package>-reconfigure` – Run the configuration step and then rebuild.
- `make legal-info` – Generate license and source compliance information.

### 7.2 Build Tips

- Use `make V=1` to get verbose command output.
- Use `make list-defconfigs` to see all available board default configs.
- For out-of-tree builds, use `make O=/path/to/output <target>`.

### 7.3 Environment Variables

- `HOSTCC` and `HOSTCXX` – Set specific compiler versions for host utilities.
- `BR2_CCACHE_DIR` – Override ccache directory location.
- `BR2_DL_DIR` – Override download directory for source packages.


## 8. Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Build Fails Due to Missing or Incompatible Toolchain

- Confirm selected toolchain type matches your architecture.
- Check that kernel header versions align with toolchain requirements.
- For external toolchains, verify that the toolchain path and prefix are set correctly.

### 8.2 Build Hangs or Fails on Specific Packages like mtools

- Ensure that dependencies for the package are installed in the host.
- Check for any patches or configurations required to fix known build failures.

### 8.3 No Compiler Found on Target

- Buildroot does not include a native compiler on targets by design.
- Use cross-compilation; native compilation on embedded devices is discouraged.

### 8.4 Device Files are Missing

- Verify and configure `/dev` management under `System Configuration` → `/dev management`:
  - Static device table (old method)
  - Dynamic using `devtmpfs` (recommended default)
  - `devtmpfs + mdev`
  - `devtmpfs + eudev` (for systemd)

### 8.5 Buildroot Configuration Changes and Rebuilds

- A full rebuild (`make clean all`) is required if you change target architecture or toolchain options.
- Adding or removing packages may not trigger rebuilds of dependent packages; manual rebuild or full rebuild is advised.
