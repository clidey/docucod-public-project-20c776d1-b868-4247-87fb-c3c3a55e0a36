# How do I write ShredOS to a USB flash drive or CD/DVD?

Securely wiping disks with ShredOS begins with creating a reliable bootable media. This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to download official ShredOS images and write them to USB flash drives or CD/DVDs, covering Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. We'll also address common issues to help you boot ShredOS smoothly and start your disk erasure journey confidently.

## 1. Choose the Correct ShredOS Image

Before writing ShredOS to your media, ensure you have the appropriate image:

- **Architecture:** Confirm whether your system requires x86_64 or i686 (32-bit) builds.
- **Boot Method:** Determine if you need BIOS or UEFI-compatible images.
- **Media Type:** Download *.iso* files for CD/DVD burning or *.img* files for USB drives.

Official releases and verification instructions are available at the [ShredOS GitHub releases page](https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64/releases).

<Tip>
Always verify the integrity of downloaded images using provided checksums to avoid corrupted or tampered files.
</Tip>

## 2. Writing ShredOS to a USB Flash Drive

### Windows

1. **Download Rufus** (https://rufus.ie/), a trusted USB writing utility.
2. Insert your USB flash drive (minimum 1GB recommended; larger drives preferred).
3. Open Rufus and select:
   - **Device:** Your USB drive.
   - **Boot selection:** Click 'SELECT' and choose your downloaded ShredOS *.img* file.
   - **Partition scheme:** Choose MBR (for BIOS) or GPT (for UEFI) based on your target firmware.
4. Click **START** and wait for the writing process to complete.
5. Safely eject the USB drive.

### Linux

1. Insert your USB drive.
2. Identify its device name via `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` (e.g., `/dev/sdX`).
3. Use the `dd` command carefully (replace `/dev/sdX` and `shredos.img` with your actual device and file):

   ```bash
   sudo dd if=shredos.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
   ```

4. Wait until the command finishes; do not interrupt.
5. Safely unmount and eject the USB drive.

### macOS

1. Insert your USB drive.
2. Find the device name via `diskutil list` (e.g., `/dev/disk2`).
3. Unmount the disk:

   ```bash
   diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
   ```

4. Write the image using `dd` (convert device name accordingly):

   ```bash
   sudo dd if=shredos.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=4m status=progress
   ```

5. Wait until complete; you may need to enter your password.
6. Eject the USB drive:

   ```bash
   diskutil eject /dev/disk2
   ```

## 3. Burning ShredOS to a CD/DVD

### Windows

1. Insert a blank CD/DVD into your optical drive.
2. Use software like [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) or built-in disc burning functionality.
3. Select "Write image to disc" and choose the ShredOS ISO file.
4. Begin the burn process and wait for completion.

### Linux

1. Insert a blank CD/DVD.
2. Use Brasero, K3b, or command-line tools:

   ```bash
   wodim dev=/dev/cdrom speed=4 -v -data shredos.iso
   ```

3. Verify burn success before ejecting.

### macOS

1. Insert a blank CD/DVD.
2. Open Disk Utility.
3. Select "Burn" from the File menu.
4. Choose the ShredOS ISO image.
5. Proceed to burn and wait.

## 4. Booting From the Created Media

- Insert the USB or CD/DVD into the target system.
- Power on and access your system’s boot menu (usually via F12, F10, F2, ESC keys).
- Select the medium with ShredOS.
- For UEFI systems, ensure boot options allow booting from external media.

<Tip>
If your system fails to recognize the boot media, double-check the image writing method and firmware boot settings (Legacy BIOS vs UEFI).
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Imaging and Boot Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems Writing or Booting ShredOS">
<Accordion title="USB Drive Not Booting">
- Confirm the image was written to the entire device, not a partition.
- Recreate the USB using a different tool (e.g., Rufus, BalenaEtcher).
- Check BIOS/UEFI settings to enable USB boot.
- Disable Secure Boot if applicable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CD/DVD Disc Not Booting">
- Verify the disc was burned as an image, not just copied as a file.
- Try reburning at a lower speed.
- Ensure your optical drive supports bootable discs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Image Writing Error or Verification Failure">
- Confirm checksum matches official releases.
- Use a different USB drive or disc.
- Re-download the image to rule out corrupt download.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="System Boots but ShredOS Interface Does Not Appear">
- Wait a few moments; early boot processes may take time.
- Confirm the medium matches your system architecture and boot mode.
- For UEFI systems, try enabling Legacy boot mode if supported.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- Use high-quality USB drives or discs to avoid media errors.
- If using USB, prefer USB 3.0 or above ports and drives for faster boot times.
- Keep a console or monitor connected to observe boot messages for quick troubleshooting.
- For repeated use, verify your boot media before each session.
- See related documentation on [Creating Bootable Media](../getting-started/installation-setup/create-bootable-media) and [Ventoy Multi-Boot Setup](../getting-started/installation-setup/ventoy-and-multi-boot) for advanced scenarios.

## 7. Next Steps

After successfully booting ShredOS from your freshly created media, you can explore secure wiping workflows by following the [Quickstart Guide](../guides/getting-started-workflows/quickstart-guide) or configuring erasure preferences in the [Configuring ShredOS Options](../getting-started/first-use-configuration/configuring-options) documentation.
