## Using ShredOS with Ventoy for Multi-Boot USB Drives

Ventoy is a popular tool that allows multiple bootable ISO or disk images to be copied onto a single USB drive with a menu-driven bootloader. ShredOS images are compatible with Ventoy, enabling users to include ShredOS alongside other operating systems on one USB stick.

### How to Set Up ShredOS on Ventoy

1. **Prepare Ventoy USB:** Follow Ventoy's official process to create a Ventoy-enabled USB drive.
2. **Copy ShredOS Images:** Simply copy the ShredOS `.iso` or `.img` files onto the Ventoy USB drive alongside other ISOs.
3. **Edit Embedded `grub.cfg` (Optional):** For advanced use cases, you may customize boot parameters by editing the embedded `grub.cfg` inside the ShredOS image. This allows tweaking wipe settings, enabling autonuke, or setting keyboard layouts.
4. **Boot from Ventoy USB:** Select ShredOS from the Ventoy menu on your target machine and boot.

### Important Tips and Best Practices

- **Image Compatibility:** Use official ShredOS `.iso` images for best compatibility with Ventoy. Use `.img` images only if explicitly supported.
- **`grub.cfg` Configuration:** When you need custom kernel parameters or automation, you'll have to extract and modify the ShredOS ISO's `grub.cfg`, then recreate the ISO or use Ventoy's menu customization features.
- **Validation:** Always test the USB on your target hardware to confirm the boot and wipe processes behave as expected.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Failed Boot or Detection Issues:** Sometimes Ventoy menu entries or image files may not load correctly if image files are corrupted or modified incorrectly.
- **Persistent Parameter Changes:** Without modification of the bootloader configs inside the ShredOS image, you cannot persist changes to wipe options or autorun modes.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see the [Ventoy and Multi-Boot Guide](/getting-started/installation-setup/ventoy-and-multi-boot) and the [Booting and Running ShredOS Guide](/guides/getting-started-workflows/booting-running-shredos).

## Booting ShredOS via PXE Network Boot

PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) boot allows loading ShredOS over the network without local USB or optical media. This is ideal for environments managing many machines remotely or disklessly.

### How to Set Up PXE Boot for ShredOS

1. **Prepare PXE Server:** Set up a TFTP and DHCP server in your network environment configured to support PXE booting.
2. **Copy ShredOS Boot Files:** Extract the necessary kernel, initramfs, and bootloader files from ShredOS images and place them in the PXE server's file directory.
3. **Configure Bootloader Entries:** Configure your PXE bootloader (e.g., PXELINUX, iPXE, or Petitboot) with ShredOS boot options and kernel command-line parameters.
4. **Network Boot Clients:** Configure client machines firmware (BIOS/UEFI) to network boot from the PXE server.
5. **Test Boot and Erase:** Boot target machines over the network and run ShredOS and `nwipe` as usual.

### Notes on PXE Boot Use with ShredOS

- **Kernel Parameters:** You must customize kernel command-line arguments in the PXE bootloader config to adjust wipe settings and automation features.
- **File Serving:** Ensure all image and boot files referenced by the PXE config are correctly served and accessible via TFTP or HTTP protocols.
- **Secure Environment:** PXE boot servers should be on secure, trusted networks since network booting opens attack vectors.

### Troubleshooting PXE Boot

- **No PXE Response:** Verify DHCP and TFTP server settings, firewall rules, and client BIOS/UEFI boot order.
- **Kernel Panic or Boot Fail:** Check that kernel and initramfs files are uncorrupted and compatible with the target hardware.
- **Network Issues:** Ensure proper IP addressing and server availability.

For comprehensive instructions and best practices, refer to the [Boot Methods & System Integration Overview](/overview/architecture/booting-integration) and specialized PXE boot server documentation.

## Editing ShredOS Images for Advanced Boot Customization

When using Ventoy or PXE boot for unattended or automated workflows, you often need to customize boot options:

- **Extract the Image:** Mount or unpack the ShredOS `.iso` to access `grub.cfg` or PXE config files.
- **Modify Kernel Parameters:** Change kernel command-line arguments for `nwipe` options such as `autonuke=1`, device exclusions, logging paths, or keyboard layouts.
- **Rebuild or Reference Modified Config:** For Ventoy, either create custom menu entries or rebuild images with the updated config. For PXE, adjust the PXE bootloader config accordingly.

<Tip>
Before modifying ShredOS images, always backup original files and verify your changes in a controlled test system to avoid accidental data loss.
</Tip>

## Summary

Using ShredOS with Ventoy or PXE network boot unlocks flexible deployment methods for secure disk wiping across diverse environments. Ventoy simplifies multi-boot USB drives with minimal setup, while PXE enables scalable network-based boots for remote wipe operations. Both require some configuration and possibly image or bootloader edits to customize wipe behavior and automate processes.

For practical workflows, start with the official Ventoy USB setup or PXE boot server configuration, then adapt ShredOS boot parameters as needed for your wiping scenarios.
