# Previous Version Highlights

Explore the evolution of Buildroot by reviewing the major highlights from earlier releases. This page summarizes key changes such as package updates, security patches, performance improvements, removals of deprecated components, interface refinements, and critical fixes implemented across versions.

---

## 2024.11 (Released December 8th, 2024)

### Overview
- This stable release integrates numerous fixes and updates across many packages including `eza`, `foot`, `gnutls`, and more.
- Build errors related to `procps-ng` from 2024.08 have been resolved.
- The release benefits from community contributions and extensive testing of release candidates.

### Notable Package Updates and Changes
- Updated packages: eza, foot, gnutls, ibm-sw-tpm2, mosquitto, and pixman.
- Resolved build errors and enhanced package stability, particularly for `procps-ng`.

### Highlights from Release Candidates
- Multiple release candidates addressed widespread fixes, updated packages across the tree including `alsa-lib`, `linux-tools`, `postgresql`, `rust`, `polkit` and others.
- New toolchain versions and defconfig additions for broad hardware support.


## Key Themes Across Recent Releases

### Security and Stability
- Critical security fixes continue to be a priority with frequent bugfix releases addressing vulnerabilities and build regressions.
- Updates to cryptographic libraries like `gnutls`, `openssl` and `libressl` keep the toolchain secure.

### Toolchain and Compiler Updates
- Newer versions of binutils, GCC and glibc are included routinely to support modern hardware and software demands.
- External toolchain support is refined, and deprecated/older toolchains are removed to streamline builds.

### Package Management
- Unmaintained or superseded packages such as `bsdiff`, `popperjs`, `midori`, and various python modules are removed ensuring a leaner and more maintainable system.
- Package renaming and splitting, e.g., `onevpl` renamed to `libvpl` and `docker-proxy` merged into `docker-engine` are reflected throughout.

### Architecture Support
- Support for legacy or less used architectures like NIOS2, i386, Blackfin, C-SKY has been dropped.
- New defconfigs and build options continue to be added for emerging platforms and boards.

### Build and Development Enhancements
- Buildroot has improved reproducibility, consistency in patch handling, and better integration with modern toolchains.
- Introduction of granular package hooks, override mechanisms for development, and layered customization encourage robust workflows.

### Upgrade and Migration
- Backward incompatible changes are documented through the `Config.in.legacy` facility.
- Migration steps include renaming old options, handling removed packages, and adjusting for new build infrastructure.

## Recommended Actions for Users

- Users upgrading from older Buildroot releases should consult migration notes in `Config.in.legacy`.
- Regularly update to supported LTS or latest releases to benefit from security and performance fixes.
- Use the Buildroot `make legal-info` and `make pkg-stats` to audit license compliance and package information.
- Leverage `make graph-depends` and `make graph-size` to understand package dependencies and filesystem size contributions.

---

## Example Highlight: Legacy Option Handling

Buildroot maintains a legacy support system for removed or renamed options, which are flagged during configuration to assist migration. For instance:

- The `bsdiff` package has been removed due to lack of maintenance.
- Buildroot no longer supports NIOS2 architecture as of 2024.
- Various python 2.x packages have been removed in line with upstream deprecation.

This ensures users receive clear guidance on updating configurations and codebases.
